    Possible values of "state" property, according to the code:

    - "/clear_update_status", // Checking for firmware update is in progress (need to keep sending request until state is changed)
    - "/update_succeeded", // Success
    - "/update_failed", // Update failed, or not required
    - "/update_staged", // Staging update?
    - "/download",  // Downloading update
    - "/update_downloaded", // Ready to update
    - "/update_unknown"

    Possible values of "status" property according to the code:

    - "ignoring", // possibly some uninterruptible action is in progress?
    - "error",
    - "nonactionable" // everything is OK

    Use case:  One user is making this request to check new firmware available, and run the upgrade, approximately 30 minutes before
      switching to discharging (self_consumption mode with 5% reserve). Assumption is - we better upgrade firmware while battery is
      in standby mode, rather then letting gateway upgrade itself later, because it will stop battery possibly during peak hours
      an upgrade. He noticed his gateway has self-upgraded during peak hours, resulting around 15 minutes stop of battery, which was
      an unpleasant surprise and extra cost. So, his idea was to force a new firmware check (and upgrade) when battery is not used:

    - 7:15am  check for new firmware and run an upgrade if firmware is available
    - 7:55am  - start discharging (self_consumption, 5% reserve)
    - 10:05pm  - start charging (backup, 100% reserve)

    Southern California Edison has TOU plan with the following details:

    - 8am-2pm,  8pm-10pm  - off-peak
    - 2pm-8pm  - peak
    - 10pm-8am  - super off-peak
