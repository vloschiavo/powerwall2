  summary: Instantaneous readings from the CT clamps
  description: |
    This returns the current readings from the meters that measure solar, grid, battery, and home production and usage.  Watts, Hz, etc.  Watt values can be positive or negative.

    1. "site" corresponds to "Grid" in the Tesla mobile app

    Positive numbers indicate power draw from the grid to the system

    Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to the grid

    2. "battery" corresponds to "Powerwall" in the Tesla mobile app - this is an aggregate number if you have more than one Powerwall

    Positive numbers indicate power draw from the batteries to the system

    Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to the batteries

    3. "load" corresponds to "Home" in the Tesla mobile app

    Positive numbers indicate power draw from the system to the home

    Negative numbers should never happen

    4. "solar" corresponds to "Solar" in the Tesla mobile app

    Positive numbers indicate power production from solar to the system

    Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to solar - this should never be higher than 100 Watts.  On occasion I see +/- -10 at night.

    5. "busway" - Not always present.  Unknown - my numbers show 0 for this.

    6. "frequency" - Not always present.  Unknown - my numbers show 0 for this.

    7. "generator" - Not always present.  Unknown I don't have a generator - my numbers show 0 for this.
