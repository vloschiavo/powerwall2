    Use this URL to determine how many power walls you have, their serial numbers, and if they are in sync (assuming more than one powerwall).

    I have two of the AC Powerwall 2s in the United States.  The PackagePartNumber is: 1092170-03-E.  Let me know if you have a different package part number and what Powerwall model you have.  (i.e. DC, AC, Powerwall v1 or v2)
