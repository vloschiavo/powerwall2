  summary: Switch between on-grid and off-grid mode
  description: |
    Sets whether the powerwall is on or off grid.  Change the value in the POSTed data to change to off-grid (`intentional_reconnect_failsafe`) or on-grid (`backup`).

    **Switching to off-grid mode:** Note that subsequent calls to [/api/system_status/grid_status/](#get-apisystem_statusgrid_status) will return `grid_status: "SystemIslandedActive"` once the system is in off-grid mode.

    **Switch to on-grid mode:** Note that subsequent calls to [/api/system_status/grid_status/](#get-apisystem_statusgrid_status) will return `grid_status: "SystemGridConnected"` once the system is back in on-grid mode.
