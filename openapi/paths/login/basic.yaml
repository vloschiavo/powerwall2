  summary: Login to the Tesla Powerwall API
  description: |
    To login to the Tesla Powerwall API, you will need either to know your Gateway serial number or your custom password.
    
    If you do not have a custom password, your password will be the last 5 digits of your Gateway serial number.  If 
      you don't know your Gateway serial number, you can get it from the Tesla app by clicking on settings, My Home 
      Info and it will be listed under "Powerwall Gateway".
    
    In the request body, username can be set to "customer", the password is the last 5 characters of your Gateway 
      serial number (or your custom password) and email, if included, can be left as an empty string.
