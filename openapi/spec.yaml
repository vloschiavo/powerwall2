    ## A community documented list of the endpoints available on the Tesla Powerwall 2

    <span style="color:red">_It does take a few seconds for the documentation to load all of the definitions._</span>

    ### Contributing

    This documentation is a work in progress. If you find any endpoints that are not documented, or are out of date, please contribute a
      pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vloschiavo/powerwall2).  Not all of the endpoints in the README.md have
      been converted over to OpenAPI spec.  Endpoints removed from [README.md.workingcopy](README.md.workingcopy) have been converted over
      and those remaining in README.md.workingcopy have not been converted over yet.  Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
      more information on how to contribute.

    ### How to use the Swagger UI Try it out feature against your own Powerwall

    Please see [USING-SWAGGER-TRY-IT-OUT.md](USING-SWAGGER-TRY-IT-OUT.md) for more information on how to use the Swagger UI Try it out feature against your own Powerwall.
